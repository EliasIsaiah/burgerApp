### Yes, but what does it do?
Burger Simulator is a list of burgers that the user can add to. Each burger gives the user the option to "devour" it and thereby move it into the devoured column. 

### What is the point of this application?
The application doesn't have an explicit practical use. It is more about experimenting with MYSQL database integration with Node.js and Express.js, using those technologies to build interactive web apps that are truly full stack in their operation.

You can visit https://trilogy-burger-app.herokuapp.com/ if you wish to demo the web application, or you can clone the repo yourself and run it that way.
